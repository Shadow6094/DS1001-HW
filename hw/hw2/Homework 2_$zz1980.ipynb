    "- Use what we've learned in class and from the book to describe how one could set Target's problem up as a predictive modeling problem, such that they could have gotten the results that they did.  Formulate your solution as a proposed plan using our data science terminology.  Include all the aspects of the formulation that you see as relevant to solving the problem.  Be precise but concise."

    "## Target Case Study - Solution Formulation Plan\n",
    "### Problem Formation\n",
    "Before we start, we will have to translate target's business problem into data mining tasks. In general, the goals can be breakdown to the followings: Proactively reach out to customers with a high likelihood of to be pregnant; Create reactive strategies to attract customers to shop at target both during at their pregnancy period and after the due date. Given these use cases, we need to be able to rank customers based on their pregnancy likelihood and estimate the potential due date. Since we have a binary outcome of interest, we can apply some form of supervised learning to solve this problem. To put it more formally, our tasks will be the following:\n",
    "1. Use available data (X) to build a supervised learning algorithm that estimates the likelihood of pregnant customers in their 2nd trimester, P(Pregnant|X)\n",
    "2. Additionally, the algorithm should also be able to provide us with an estimated due date give available data (X).\n",
    "3. Develop a framework for incorporating our probability estimates into one or more promotion strategies to attract customer shopping at Target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration\n",
    "The next crucial step is explore and understand to raw data. This process starts from finding answers for questions like where the data coming from; how was the data sampled, collected and aggregated; One important task while trying to answer those questions is finding potential bias in the sample data. Following that, we will look into the data set to see what the data look like and find potential structures in the data set. The objective here is to find relevant variables to our algorithm by and, if necessary, remove redundant variables by looking at statistics such as correlation and mutual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Modeling and Evaluation\n",
    "Once finishing the data exploration, we can start building our predictive model. Given the problem formation and data exploration steps, we now can narrow down our scope to a few model options and designs which are applicable in current context. The goal is to run controlled experiments against multiple model choices and find out the most suitable one. Prior to running the experiments, we will need to clearly define the evaluation plan, which includes how to split the data (e.g. training vs. validation data), which evaluation methods to use (e.g. time vs accuracy), etc. Besides the quantitative evaluation, it is also important to ensure that the model satisfies the original business goals. Only after all the stakeholders sign off on the model, it can move on to the deployment phase.\n"

    "### Part 2: Exploring data in the command line\n",
    "For this part we will be using the data file located in `\"advertising_events.csv\"`. This file consists of records that pertain to some online advertising events on a given day. There are 4 comma separated columns in this order: `userid`, `timestamp`, `domain`, and `action`. These fields are of type `int`, `int`, `string`, and `int` respectively. Answer the following questions using Linux/Unix bash commands. All questions can be answered in one line (sometimes, with pipes)! Some questions will have many possible solutions. Don't forget that in IPython notebooks you must prefix all bash commands with an exclamation point, i.e. `\"!command arguments\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hints: You can experiment with whatever you want in the notebook and then delete things to construct your answer later.  You can also use ssh to use the actual bash shell in your terminal and then just paste your answers here. Recall that once you enter the \"!\" then filename completion should work. Also, these are standard data exploration commands that are quick and easy to use in a terminal or in the notebook. We don't cover command line operations formally in this class, but these are worth learning (and thus are part of the HW). Be resourceful. Use whatever online cheat sheets or Stackoverflow to answer the question.]"
